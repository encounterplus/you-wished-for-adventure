# Starting the Adventure

### How to use this Adventure Guide

This adventure is written for new and veteran players alike. It's purpose to help, quickly get you using Encounter+, our very favorite virtual tabletop app. Through out you will see marked off sections labeled as such: 

> **LEARN HOW:** to do a thing
>{.flowchart}

These sections will guide you through different features of Encounter+ that are relevant to that section of the guide. Additionally, you'll see that there are several links within the adventure - **[They Look Like this]()**. Tapping on these will take you to reference material within your compendium inside the app. *If you forgot to import the default compendium when you first turned open Encounter+ you can do so again from the Settings panel in the app*

If you'd like to peruse through the tutorials seperately just head to the "Learn How" folder in this adventure's content list. 

With that being said, let's get started with the first section: **[Where are we?](where-are-we)**
