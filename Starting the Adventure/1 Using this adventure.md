# Starting the Adventure

### How to use this Adventure Guide

This adventure is written for new and veteran players alike. It's purpose to help, quickly get you using Encounter+, our very favorite virtual tabletop app. Through out you will see marked off sections labeled as such: 

`LEARN HOW: to do a thing`

These sections will guide you through different features of Encounter+ that are relevant to that section of the guide. Additionally, you'll see that there are several links within the adventure - [They Look Like this](). Tapping on these will take you to reference material within your compendium inside the app. *If you forgot to import the default compendium when you first turned open Encounter+ you can do so again from the Settings panel in the app*
