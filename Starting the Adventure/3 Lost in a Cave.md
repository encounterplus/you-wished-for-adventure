## Lost in a Cave

The mansion suddenly disappears around the party, including the floor. The entire group falls through complete blackness for a moment, but the feeling of weightlessness is suddenly met with oddly squishy ground below them and rocky cavern walls around them. Have everyone in the party roll a **DC 18 Dexterity Saving Throw**; any who fail are knocked prone. There is also no source of lighting in this space and only creatures who provide a light source or have Darkvision can see.

> ***Ceilings.*** The cielings of the caverns are irregular and naturally made. While there is some flucuation, the height of the ceilings throughought the caverns are between 10 and 12 feet. 
> 
> ***Light.*** No areas of the cavern, excluding the cistern are lit. Players will either need Darkvision or their own source of light to be able to see. 
> 
> ***Tunnels.*** The separate caverns are connected by narrow tunnels. The walls of these tunnels are irreguluar but typically force players to walk single-file through them.
