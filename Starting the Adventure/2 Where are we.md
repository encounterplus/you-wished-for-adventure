## Where are we?

The adventure begins with the party slowly opening their eyes. They groggily begin to register their senses after this unexpected state of unconsciousness and find themselves in the middle of a small town they don't recognize. It is a relatively small town, although the homes seem affluent, large and well built. The main roadway through the town is paved in perfectly symmetrical cobblestones with an empty fountain in the center. As the players look around and get their bearings the silence is the most noticeable thing about this place. You would expect a place like this to be a bit more bustling at midday, but there is no sound. You would expect the residents of a place like this to be to-ing and fro-ing, but there are no people. The homes are unlit and empty. The chimneys are clean and smokeless. 

As the Dungeon Master, you can determine if and how the players know each other. This opening instance is intended to accomplish two things: first, introduce the characters to each other (i.e., describing their characters’ descriptions and a bit of their personalities); and second give your players space to acclimate to the setting.

Once they've gotten a feel for what they see you can have them explore the town a bit more. All of the homes are unlocked and empty. With the exception of the Mansion at the edge of the road, nothing of value is inside any of them. You may simply describe what the players see inside. 


> "The home is well furnished and immaculately clean. In fact, it's eerily spotless. There are no occupants and is just as devoid of life as the town outside."

After the players have explored an empty house or two, have them roll perception checks as they gather information on what to do next. Any player who successfully rolls the **DC 11 Perception check** needed for this, see a strange flicker. Just for an instant they see the well built homes they are surrounded by become ruined and collapsed. The cobblestone road they stand upon becomes a dirt strip covered with weeds. Almost as soon as they see it, it reverts back to the luxurious space it was before. The only building that didn't change in this flicker is a large mansion at the far end of the road. Players who succeeded the earlier perception check can see this flicker continuing at routine intervals. The closer they get to this building the more constant the flickering seems. 

The players can enter through the front door with ease as it is also unlocked. When they do they find what is likely the most opulent interior they've ever seen. The mansion is filled with expensive artwork, pottery, and tapestries. It is brightly lit by wall sconces, candelabras and chandeliers. The players can hear muffled voices coming from further inside the mansion although they aren't certain where. You may use your discretion to determine how (and when) they find the source of these voices. If the players attempt to pickup or take anything from the mansion all of them are immediately teleported to where they first awoke in the town. They once again awaken from unconscious -- unharmed, but woozy. Eventually, as they explore the mansion they will enter a large dining area. As they enter this space they'll find the source of the voices are coming from a well dressed, well groomed man arguing with a large, red-skinned, heavily muscled creature with pointy teeth and short horns protruding from its bald head. Players can roll a **DC 15 Arcana or Religion check** (you may let them choose) to ascertain that this large being is in fact an [Efreeti](/monster/efreeti). 

The man and Efreeti will finally notice that the players have entered. The man will be shocked and upset. The Efreeti will chuckle rather heartily. 

He puts his hands wide and says, *"You see Barlow, you wanted the perfect town and the perfect town needs heroes, doesn’t it?”*

He continues to laugh as the man, Barlow, angrily reprimands the Efreeti, *"You know this isn't what I meant, now get rid of these idiots like you did the rest."*

*"Your wish is my command,"* the Efreeti ominously says while laughing manically.
