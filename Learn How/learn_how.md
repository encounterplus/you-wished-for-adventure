## Running Encounters

Running encounters in Encounter+ is fun, simple and helps you focus on the exiting parts of combat. 

Encounter+ is a great way to manage any combat encounter. It’s designed to quickly add creatures or NPCs as well Player Characters on the fly. It’s also designed to keep track of various conditions both positive and negative for each creature and Player in an encounter.
 
> **First things first, what is an encounter?** 
>
>An encounter is a collection of creatures assembled for the intent of going up against your player characters. An encounter is not part of a map. It’s a stand alone “object” that you can use with a map but techinically it is not part of the map. We keep enounters decoupled to provide flexibility. Using this approach allows you to mix and match encounters with maps. You can use any encounter with any map.

#### 1. Creating an Encounter

There are several encounters included in the "You Wished For Adventure!" starter module. You can simply open and load these from the Library to get all of the monsters inserted in one fell swoop. 
That being said, you can also follow the steps listed below to customize encounters as well as insert the Player Characters

* Tap the Initiative Order button in the top left of the screen. It looks like a pair of upward and downard pointing arrows. 
    - ![Settings Button](settings_button.png)
* Tap the "..." more button on the top right of this menu.
* Select **"+ Insert Creatures"**      

* Choose between the following:
  
    - Monster or NPC: This will open the built-in Compendium for all the creatures stored within Encounter+.
 
    - Player Character: This will add any Player Characters that have been added tothe Encounter+ Compendium.

    ***Note**: The only creatures included in the Compendium are from the Systems Reference Document in compliance with Wizards of the Coast Open Gaming License v1.0a.*

    *Players can be added to the Compendium via tapping on the Library icon in the top right of the app.*

- The Checkmark can be tapped multiple times to add several of the same creature to a combat encounter.

#### 2. Starting Combat

Now that the monsters and players in your encounter are loaded, let's start combat. 

Tap **Start** in the bottom left of the screen to start the encounter. This will roll initiative for all the enemies in the encounter. 

***Note:** By default the app doesn’t roll initiative for the Player Characters. If desired, the app can roll for the PCs as well. Tap on the settings and change that setting.*

#### 3. Managing Combat

Manage the encounter by tapping on the **Initiative Order** icon.

For Player Characters, manually add their initiative into the Initiative block if the app is not rolling for their characters. You may notice there is also a helpful "ROLL" feature available here that will allow you roll for players characters as well. 

Creature and character health are tracked here as well. Tap on the creatures health and type in the amount of damage that creature has taken into the Damage Calculator. It will automatically subtract. Tap anywhere on the screen to dismiss the Damage Calculator.

*   ***Note:** Tap on the "MOD" button in the Damage Calculator to change the number to healing as opposed to damage.*

Tapping on the Arrows in the bottom right corner of the app interface once the Combat has started will highlight the next or previous creature in the initiative order to keep track of turns.

#### 4. Ending Combat

Once the combat has concluded, tap the **"Stop"** button in the lower left corner of the interface and the combat will end. Combat can be resumed if the Start button is tapped and combat will resume where the initiative last left off.

*   ***Note:** Combat can be toggled on or off at will. Combat does have to be stopped in order to add additional creatures to the combat. When Start is tapped there is an option to re-roll initiative. Tap Later if combat is to be resumed without re-rolling initiative.*

## Marking Creatures as Friendly

Thankfully, Encounter+ lets you easily mark any creature as "Friendly," so you manage them appropriately in encounter situations. To do so follow these steps. 

1. Find the creature you need in the Library and load into your encounter. You can find a guide on how to do so [here](running-encounters).

2. Swipe to left on the creature you'd like to change. You'll see a three buttons slide in. Tap on the yellow Edit button. 
    - ![Edit Creature](creature_edit.png =200x)
